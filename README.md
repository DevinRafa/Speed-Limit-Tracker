# Speed-Limit-Tracker
Speed Limit Tracer object. with optimization my If With Initializer, Integral Logic Conditions, Short Circuit Evaluation


in this repository I'II be created about speed limit tracker with out any conclusion abaout my selft to practice my anything about sub addition in if statment
that i been and still learn abaout c++ 20 in this month. that i been study about if with e.g initializer, inegral logic conditions, short circuit evaluation, etc.

off course my source code it's may just to short or have must been any optimization, you can fix any things in this code with still have a red line with sub if statment.
or maybe out off the sub id statment.

next update i will add much more in sub if statment. ASAP!

in this things you need to input your speed; and systems will detected and organized your speed
